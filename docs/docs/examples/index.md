# Code Examples

In this section you will find a list of code examples on what you can build with LangStream. Due to the focus of LangStream to keep the core light, we prefer to provide extensive examples of what you can do rather than extensive pre-made classes that do it for you, this makes it easier for you to understand how everything is working and connected together, and simply adapt to your use-case.
